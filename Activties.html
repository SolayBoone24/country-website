Recreation in Ancient Egypt took many forms. These included banquets and hunting and fishing. They went sailing on the Nile river and they enjoyed music and dancing. Games included board games, games with balls, and tug-of-war. <br><br><br> Their homes were built to deal with the extremes of the climate. The weather could be up to 120 degrees Fahrenheit (48 degrees C) on a summer afternoon and as cold as the 30s in degrees Fahrenheit ( around 2 degrees C) on a winter night. </p>
